          <h1>About the Map</h1>
          <p>
            This world map presents data on air pollution indices as calculated
            by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). IHME has
            developed its own metrics for assessing air quality, measuring air
            pollutant particles in parts per billion. Figures 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and
            1.4 each provide different perspectives on IHME's air quality index.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, a higher index value indicates an increased risk of
            illness due to water contamination, compromised food supplies, and
            the spread of diseases.

            The chart shows the trend in Air Pollution deaths accoding to the
            2019 IHME index for 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2016.

            <strong>Asia:</strong>
            9.09
            <strong>Oceania:</strong>

            <strong>Africa:</strong>

            <strong>North America:</strong>

            <strong>South America:</strong>

            <strong>Europe:</strong>
            5.98
          </ul>

          <p>
            Asia has the highest average share of deaths due to air pollution,
            followed by Oceania and Africa. Europe has the lowest average death
            rate (IHME 2019) at 2016 .
          </p>
          <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
          <p>
            The data suggests that the share of deaths attributable to
            <strong>air pollution </strong> is
            <strong>decreasing</strong> globally over time, according to the
            IHME index. This could imply a number of things:
          </p>
          <p>
            Improved Air Quality, Improved healthcare systems, medical
            treatments, and overall a Shift in Causes of Death.

            measured parts per billion
          </p>
          <p>
            North Korea and Solomon Islands remain top 5 worst in both 1990 and
            2016
          </p>
          <p>
            North Korea maintained its position as the most polluted country,
            however, its air pollution level declined from 17.19 to 16.51 in 36
            years. Similarly, Solomon Islands experienced a decrease in
            pollution levels and moved up in ranking from 5th to 4th place.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, new countries emerged in the 2016 data, notably
            Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. These countries were not present in
            the 1990 dataset. Conversely, countries like China, Cambodia, and
            Tajikistan, which were part of the 1990 list, are missing from the
            2016 data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, while some countries have managed to reduce their air
            pollution levels, new countries have appeared on the list,
            indicating shifts in the global landscape of air pollution.
